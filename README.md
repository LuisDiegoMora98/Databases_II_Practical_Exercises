# Databases_II_Practical_Exercises

A simple practical repository for databases II course, it will have relational and non-relational databases exercises.

## Getting Started

We will have 2 folders, relational and non-relational. Both folders has practices and a test database script so you will be able to work under the same fields and names (although you are free fork the repo and to edit the files in order to run in other database)

## Prerequisites

Install SQL Server (this scripts are tested in both Windows and Linux SO) and make sure you have running your instance server.

PD: Inside Relational we have the CRUD script for a test database.
